Windows Terminal Toying Around

## What is this mess?

This repository contains a Windows Terminal JSON profile and some images to demonstrate some of the interesting ways you can customize the Windows Terminal application. **This only works for Windows 10 as far as I know**

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10
* Windows Terminal (install from the Microsoft Store)
* PowerShell 5.1, 6.x, 7
* Note: Azure Cloud Shell is included in this profile, but it requires separate/additional setup in Azure to connect from Terminal

## Setup

* Download the "profiles.json" file from this repository (or click Raw, select-all, and copy to clipboard)
* Launch Windows Terminal
* Click the down-arrow menu button (on the tabs menu bar) and click Settings
* If prompted to select an editor, choose whatever you prefer (I use Visual Studio Code)
* Save a copy of your existing "profiles.json" in case you want to revert back to the current state
* Replace with the contents of the profiles.json in this repository, and Save it

You should see the Terminal update immediately, however, in some cases you may need to close and reopen it.

## Customize it Your Way

* Make a GitHub repository
* Copy your image files into the repo
* Copy the URL for use in your profiles.json 

Cheers!
