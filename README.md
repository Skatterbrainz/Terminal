Windows Terminal Customization

## What is this mess?

This repository contains a Windows Terminal JSON profile and some wallpaper images to demonstrate some of the 
interesting ways you can customize the Windows Terminal application.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or higher
* Windows Terminal 1.1x (install from the Microsoft Store, winget or Chocolatey)
* Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 7.1.3 or later
* Note: Azure Cloud Shell is included in this profile, but it requires separate/additional setup in Azure to connect from Terminal

## Setup

* Download the "settings.json" file from this repository (or click Raw, select-all, and copy to clipboard)
* Open Windows Terminal
* Open the Settings panel
* Click Open JSON (use any editor you prefer)
* SaveAs to make a backup of your current settings.json file
* Replace the contents with the sample you copied to the clipboard, Save it!

You should see the Terminal update immediately, however, in some cases you may need to close and reopen it.

## Customize it Your Way

* Make a GitHub repository
* Copy your image files into the repo
* Copy the URL for each image file to use in your Terminal profile (or settings.json file)

Cheers!
