Windows Terminal Customization

## What is this mess?

This repository contains a Windows Terminal JSON profile and some wallpaper images to demonstrate some of the 
interesting ways you can customize the Windows Terminal application.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or higher
* Windows Terminal (install from the Microsoft Store, winget or Chocolatey)
* Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell Core 7.1.3 or later
* Note: Azure Cloud Shell is included in this profile, but it requires separate/additional setup in Azure to connect from Terminal

## Setup

* Download the "settings.json" file from this repository (or click Raw, select-all, and copy to clipboard)
* **Launch** Windows Terminal
* Click the down-arrow menu button (on the tabs menu bar) and click **Settings**
* If prompted to select an editor, choose whatever you prefer (I use Visual Studio Code)
* Save a **Backup** of your existing "settings.json" in case you want to revert back to the current state
* **Replace** with the contents of the settings.json in this repository, and **Save** it

You should see the Terminal update immediately, however, in some cases you may need to close and reopen it.

## Customize it Your Way

* Make a GitHub repository
* Copy your image files into the repo
* Copy the URL for each image file to use in your Terminal profile (or settings.json file)

Cheers!
